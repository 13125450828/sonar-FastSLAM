'L[0-9]*F[0-9]*R[0-9]*t[0-9]*\n'
	Sensor measurements
	e.g.
	'L30F15R9999t5'	30 cm on the right
			15 cm on the front
			out of range on the right
				(either very far or very close)
			time: 5 ms after last engine change
'el(-?)[0-9]*er(-?)[0-9]*cor(-?)[0-9]*t[0-9]*'
	Motor update, e.g.
	'el300er-300cor50t500'
		Engine Left was put on 300 forward
		Engine Right put on -300, thus 300 backwrad
		The left engine has a correction, for calibration
			cor was actually added to run it (but can be ignored)
		t 500: 500 ms elapsed after the previous engine change (or boot)
